Branch focus:
- **Foundations and First Proofs** covers rigorous single/multivariable calculus with plentiful exercises and worked solutions.  
- **Core Real Analysis** develops abstract sequences, topology, and measure-ready theorems (Tao, Rudin, Royden-Fitzpatrick).  
- **Measure Theory and Integration** deepens Lebesgue/Differentiation techniques, setting up modern analysis.  
- **Princeton Lectures** align per volume (Fourier, Complex, Real, Functional) and dovetail with Tao and Brezis for cross-references.  
- **Functional Analysis and PDE Interfaces** connect Banach/Hilbert frameworks with Sobolev/PDE applications, ideal after the measure tier.

## Suggested Learning Paths

1. **Foundations → Real Analysis Core → Measure Theory**  
   - Start with Wade (text plus solutions) to build comfort with proofs.  
   - Follow with Marsden & Hoffman for multivariable rigor.  
   - Move into Tao Analysis I & II, then reinforce abstraction via Rudin or Royden–Fitzpatrick.  
   - Transition to Lebesgue theory with Tao’s *Introduction to Measure Theory* and Wheeden–Zygmund for deeper applications.

2. **Measure Theory → Functional Analysis → PDE Applications**  
   - After the measure texts above, read Buhler & Salamon’s ETH notes for a quick functional analysis foundation.  
   - Proceed to Stein & Shakarchi Vol. 4 for operator-focused analysis.  
   - Capstone with Brezis to connect functional analysis to Sobolev spaces and partial differential equations.

3. **Princeton Lectures in Analysis Track**  
   - Use the Vol. 1–4 collection for the full program (Fourier, Complex, Real, Functional).  
   - Pair the physical Vol. 3 and Vol. 4 files for quick access to those topics.  
   - Integrate related references: Tao Analysis I/II align with Vol. 3, and Brezis/Wheeden serve as advanced companions once the Princeton sequence is complete.

4. **Author-Centric Tao Route**  
   - Work through *Analysis I* → *Analysis II* → *Introduction to Measure Theory*.  
   - Supplement with Rudin for alternate presentations and Stein & Shakarchi Vol. 4 for functional analysis continuity.

5. **(My Path) Zygmund-First Route**  
   - This mirrors my actual study flow: start from *Wheeden & Zygmund - Measure and Integral* and fan out both backward and forward.  
   - Backfill any missing foundations by dipping into Tao Analysis I/II or Rudin whenever topology/sequence results are needed.  
   - Extend forward toward functional analysis and PDE texts (Buhler & Salamon, Stein & Shakarchi Vol. 4, Brezis) so the measure insights connect with operator theory and Sobolev applications.
